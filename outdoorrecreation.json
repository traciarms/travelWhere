American kestrels and other raptors often soar overhead, hunting small mammals and reptiles. As rodents scurry through grasslands, they mark their trails with urine, which absorbs ultraviolet light. Raptors such as kestrels can see UV light, a trait that enables them to track the rodents along these &quot;urine highways&quot; through the grasslands.

The CCC Ponds are an important historical feature to the Pinedale Area. These Ponds were re-constructed during the 1990's and given specific themes to provide for various wildlife species: the Fish Pond, Duck Pond, Beaver Pond, and Frog Pond. A walking path was added to enable public access, as well as the installation of benches, interpretive signs and a parking lot. Over the years the area has seen increasing recreational use from Wyoming natives and visitors alike in the form of fishing and non-motorized activities such as walking and bird watching. Attached to the CCC Ponds parking area is a paved bike path called the Pinedale Pathway that loops from the parking lot back down into town for a round trip of about 6 miles.

The trail crosses over the Green River and under Interstate 405, then turns straight south within the Puget Sound Energy powerline corridor. The alignment crosses a wide variety of landscapes and provides views of many regional activities. Following the BNSF railroad south, the landscape passes through historic industrial areas and suburban lands before crossing the broad Green River Valley. The trail provides access to the Southcenter area, Renton Junction, downtown Kent, Emerald Downs in Auburn, and the communities of Algona and Pacific. The trail currently ends at 3rd Avenue SW in Pacific. A second southern intersection with the Green River Trail occurs at Kent's Foster Park, providing the possibility of an Interurban-Green River Trail recreational loop through the Green River Valley.
